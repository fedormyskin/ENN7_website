The European Narratology Network invites submissions to the 2023 conference about narrative processes, devices, and experiences in literature, film, theater, digital media, etc. across all European languages and cultures.

This year’s conference is co-located with IGEL 2023, the conference of the International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature, and the common theme is *Rhythm, Speed, Path: Spatiotemporal Experiences in Narrative, Poetry, and Drama*. Submissions related to this topic will be given priority but submissions about other topics are also welcome. The deadline for submission is **February 24th, 2023**.  

The aim of the conference is to offer a space for a discussion about the role and enactment of spatiotemporal experiences in narrative, lyrical, and performative works. The focus should be on narrative theory in relation to literary studies, theory of versification, performance studies and other relevant domains.

We welcome contributions related to formal and thematic perspectives about spatial configurations in narrative (e.g. linear, circular, cyclical), spatial patterns (e.g. goal-oriented, free exploration), and spatial attributes related to genres, forms, techniques, and themes.

## Possible topics

We encourage submissions related to (but not limited to):

- Measures of narrative speed and duration in literature and in a transmedia perspective
- Rhythm in fiction and in poetry
- Wandering minds and bodies in poetry, theater, and narrative; walking as embodied storytelling; bodily movement as prompt of poetic and narrative forms, e.g. in Dante’s *Comedy*, flânerie, stream of consciousness (e.g. Joyce’s *Dubliners*, Dujardin’s *Les lauriers sont coupés*)
- The chronotope of the road: link between movement and literary techniques (e.g. linear fairy tales; Pindaric novels; disordered-without-aim stream of consciousness) 
- Themes: means of transportation (from horse to spaceships) and narrative progression; exodus, odyssey, diaspora, migration, pilgrimage.
