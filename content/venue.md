Monopoli is a little town near Bari in Puglia, a region in Southern Italy. Its characteristic historical centre of early medieval origin overlooks the sea and it's surrounded by high walls facing the Adriatic Sea. During the free time, it will be possible for you to admire churches, noble palaces, squares, ancient alleys, the harbour, and even a few beaches.

The conference will be held in Monopoli’s **Diocesan Museum**, located in the town’s historic center, next to the Basilica of the Madonna della Madia. 

Plenary sessions will take place in the great hall on the ground floor, whereas parallel sessions will be held in other rooms upstairs, between the first and the second floor. Reception stand and coffee breaks will be in the [building](https://goo.gl/maps/r4gUCpzK4xJgDfYn8) across the square, in front of the Basilica.

# About the venue

Monopoli’s Diocesan Museum was established in 2002, in the venues of the ancient Episcopal Seminary, founded originally in 1668. The Museum architecture and its collection testify Monopoli’s transculturality: the town has always been a meeting-port between the West and the East, having been under the influence of the Byzantines, the Angevins, the Aragones and the Venetians. The rooms of the Museum display paintings, icons, manuscripts, and various manufactures of great artistic value. The atmosphere is particularly linked to the religious and cultural history of the area, which has been a centre of pilgrimage for several centuries. The conference is obviously a secular event but we thought worthwile mentioning that religious  elements will be visible at the venue.
